Sample project that demonstrates how simple e-shop cart can look like. Created to show how do I understand domain-driven design.
* Domain objects
* Layers
* Unit testing
* Contract testing
* Doctrine infrastructure

You can also see how do I program, commit, what technology I can handle...

## Dynamic Prices :

Prices are not stored in the Cart itself but are loaded on demand.
This is a common use-case because we usually need fresh prices from a database or ERP.

Cart is separated from "loading prices" by an interface [`Prices`](src/Domain/Prices/Prices.php).
This is a domain element but have to be implemented by the project needs - by API calls or database queries.

## Fixed Prices :

Once we add a product into the cart, the price may be fixed.
If it is the project use-case, check out [fixed-prices version](https://github.com/simara-svatopluk/cart/tree/fixed-prices).

## How to Assemble Real Application :

We have to implement domain interfaces by our infrastructure, eg. if we use Doctrine, we implement [`DoctrineRepository`](src/Infrastructure/DoctrineCartRepository.php),
if we use CSV for storing pricing, we implement [`CsvPrices`](src/Infrastructure/CsvPrices.php) and so on by the project needs.

Then we register these classes in or favorite DI container.
If you don't know how, you can find inspiration in [`DependenciesTest`](tests/Application/DependenciesTest.php).

We can use domain objects directly in UI/CLI/target layer, and then we have to pass objects like [`Repositories`](src/Domain/Cart/CartRepository.php) to that layer.
Or we can wrap domain objects into classes that represent full use-cases.
You may call them handlers/facades/[`useCases`](src/Application/CartUseCase.php)/... depending on the project infrastructure.

## TDD :

This project was written in the spirit of TDD, see [commits](https://github.com/simara-svatopluk/cart/commits/TDD).
